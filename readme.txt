This child theme is also useful as a starting point for everyone using WPBakery Page Builder as the editor of choice. It loads basic libraries and styles and makes columns and row's options compatible with AJAX page transitions. It does not cover the whole range of WPBakery elements or add-ons. Each element may require additional libraries and/or styles to be enqueued and initialized in childscript.js
